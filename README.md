# React Portfolio

## Description

![portfolio 1](./src/assets/portfolio%20screenshot.png)

This web text editor enables users to write text in the application and save it for later use. This single page application meets the PWA criteria and features a number of data persistance techniques that serve as redundancy in case the options are not supported by the browser or the browser is offline. Users are also able to install the application onto their machine, and utilise it away from their browser. This application has been deployed to Render. In this project I was able to learn more about Progressive Web Applications and how to implement methods for storing and retrieving data.

Created using React, this professional portfolio has been created for myself, Ashlyn McGarry, as I look to move into a creer in web development. In doing this I aim to appeal to prospective employers and showcase my skills and applications as well as provide a breif bio and contact details. Users are able to see a breif about me, my skills, download my resume, see previous projects I've completed along with links to the repository and either a demo or the live app, and submit a contact form to get in touch with me. This project has allowed me to utilise the React framework and learn about how that works alongside Vite.
